The GoodData UI SDK is a library that provides all the building blocks you need to create a smart business application powered by GoodData.

With the GoodData UI SDK, you can:

- Display saved visualizations from [Analytical Designer](https://secure.gooddata.com/analyze) using the Visualization component
- Create visualizations programmatically on the fly
- Connect interactive controls to your visualization to provide unique user experience (for example, an Attribute Filter dropdown)
- Query GoodData for specific insights into your data to handle them with a custom component
