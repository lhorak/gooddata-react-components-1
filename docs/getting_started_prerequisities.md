To integrate the GoodData UI SDK in your application, you must meet the following requirements:

- Be familiar with the modern JavaScript ecosystem.
- Have node.js and yarn installed in your development environment. If you do not have these tools installed, you can get them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (install first) and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) respectively.
- Have an account on the GoodData platform. If you do not have a GoodData account yet, create a trial one.

> Examples in this documentation use data from the GoodSales demo project that is available for trial GoodData accounts.
